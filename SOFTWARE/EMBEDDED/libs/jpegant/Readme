Jpegant - JPEG encoder for embedded applications
------------------------------------------------

First of all I want to give credit to giants on wich shoulders I stood and
borrowed some ideas and code from:

- Santosh for his article about DCT, www.geocities.com/ssavekar, ssavekar@yahoo.com;
- Emil Mikulic for DCT code, dmr.ath.cx;
- Cristi Cuturicu for his JPEG codec code;
- Embedded JPEG Codec Library for inspiration and an example of how a code should
  not be written :), sourceforge.net/projects/mb-jpeg;

JPEG file decoding utility 'JPEGsnoop' was wery usefull,

The goal
--------

To create JPEG encoder that is able to work in microcontrollers/microprocessors.
It should be very fast and its code/data should be small. The image quality is
important too but is not my main concern. No floating point numbers of course.


Implementation
--------------

Encoder is written in C, if you see C++ code it should be a support code for
some paltform/architecture.

Encoder consists of files:
dct.c, dct.h	- Discrete Cosine Transform DCT;
jpeg.c, jpeg.h	- Quantization, Huffman lossless coding and JFIF;
arch.h		- Architecture specific defines;


The code itself does not depend on any libraries, SDKs, OS calls.
The resulting JPEG stream is flushed via callback function
	write_jpeg(const unsigned char buff[], const unsigned size)
which the application should create to save the data any way it likes.

For example this code saves jpeg stream into a file:

static int file_jpg = 0; // POSIX file handler

void write_jpeg(const unsigned char buff[], const unsigned size)
{
	write(file_jpg, buff, size);
}

Supported OS-es
---------------

At present this code was compiled and run on Linux (Makefile is provided)
and Windows. It is not difficult to port this code to any architecture,
the only concern may be size of int type - I asume that it is 32 bit long.
